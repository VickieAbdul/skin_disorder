# Skin disorder prediction
This project focuses on predicting skin disorders by analyzing various clinical features. Using a dataset with columns such as erythema, scaling, definite borders, itching, and specific skin involvements (like scalp and elbows), we aim to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between different skin conditions. By incorporating features like family history, melanin levels, and microscopic characteristics like eosinophils and fibrosis, our model seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support dermatologists in providing more effective treatments.
In this report, we address three key tasks:

#### 1. Data Analysis Report: 
We will perform a comprehensive data analysis on the given dataset, exploring its attributes, distributions, and potential correlations. This analysis will provide insights into the data’s characteristics and guide subsequent modeling efforts.
#### 2. Predictive Model Creation: 
Our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the various classes of skin diseases. By leveraging clinical and histopathological features, we aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist healthcare professionals.
#### 3. Early Identification Suggestions: 
We will offer recommendations to doctors for identifying skin diseases at the earliest stages. Early detection is critical for timely intervention and better patient outcomes.
