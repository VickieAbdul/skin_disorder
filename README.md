# Skin disorder prediction
Skin diseases, particularly erythemato-squamous conditions, pose a significant challenge in dermatology due to their overlapping clinical features. Conditions like psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris share common symptoms such as erythema and scaling. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment, but histopathological features can be similar across these diseases.
In this report, we address three key tasks:

#### 1. Data Analysis Report: 
We will perform a comprehensive data analysis on the given dataset, exploring its attributes, distributions, and potential correlations. This analysis will provide insights into the data’s characteristics and guide subsequent modeling efforts.
#### 2. Predictive Model Creation: 
Our goal is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the various classes of skin diseases. By leveraging clinical and histopathological features, we aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist healthcare professionals.
#### 3. Early Identification Suggestions: 
We will offer recommendations to doctors for identifying skin diseases at the earliest stages. Early detection is critical for timely intervention and better patient outcomes.
